# omicidxClient

This site discusses interrogation of metadata related to NCBI SRA in the
[OmicIDX system](https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/swaggerdoc) by Sean Davis of NCI.

This site also provides specific background on metadata handling for the
[Waldronlab](https://github.com/waldronlab) [curatedMetagenomicsData project](https://waldronlab.io/curatedMetagenomicData/).


Our objective in this site is to explain and exercise OmicIDX.
